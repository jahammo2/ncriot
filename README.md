[NC RIoT](http://ncriot.org/)

This was a project I did on a private [Smashing Boxes](https://github.com/smashingboxes) repo. I was the main developer on the project and I handled both the front end and back end work (plus DevOps :D). The purpose is to give NC RIoT a web site and the ability to easily update the blog, directory, and sponsor content of the site. 

### Technologies used
- Back End
  + Ruby on Rails
  + Devise
  + Carrierwave
  + PostgreSQL
  + Active Admin (the CMS)
- Front End
  + Sass
  + CoffeeScript
- DevOps
  + [Taperole](https://github.com/smashingboxes/taperole)
